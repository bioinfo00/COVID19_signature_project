# COVID-19 signature project
Welcome to the COVID-19 signature project. The goal of the project was to identify a blood transcriptional signature able to distinguish 
COVID-19 from healthy controls, while producing marginal cross-reactivity with other infections and confounding factors. The repository contains the data and code to reproduce the manuscript main and supplementary figures. 

**To reproduce the results, please download the [data folder](https://www.google.com)**
